# UNet

This repository contains an implementation of the U-Net architecture.

## Setup

To set up the development environment and configure the `sys.path`:

1. Run the `init_dev_env.sh` script:

   ```
   $ source init_dev_env.sh
   ```

   This script will create an IPython startup file that adds the project directory to `sys.path`, allowing you to import modules from this project in Jupyter Notebook.

2. Restart Jupyter Notebook for the changes to take effect.

## Usage

For usage examples and demonstrations of the UNet implementation, please refer to the `unet-example.ipynb` notebook in this repository.
